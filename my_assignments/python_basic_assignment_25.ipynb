    "* The **main difference is that map applies a function call to each item, and list comprehensions apply arbitrary expressions**. \n",
    "* Because of this, **list comprehensions are more general**; they can apply a function call expression like map, **but map requires a function to apply** other kinds of expressions. \n",
