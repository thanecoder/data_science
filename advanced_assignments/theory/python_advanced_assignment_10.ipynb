    "* The __getattr__ method is run for fetches of undefined attributes only—i.e., those not present on an instance and not inherited from any of its classes. \n",
    "* By contrast,the __getattribute__ method is called for every attribute fetch, whether the attribute is defined or not. \n",
    "* Because of this, code inside a __getattr__ can freely fetch other attributes if they are defined, whereas __getattribute__ must use special code for all such attribute fetches to avoid looping (it must route fetches to a superclass to skip itself)."

    "* Properties serve a specific role, while descriptors are more general. \n",
    "* Properties define get, set, and delete functions for a specific attribute; descriptors provide a class with methods for these actions, too, but they provide extra flexibility to support more arbitrary actions. \n",
    "* In fact, properties are really a simple way to create a specific kind of descriptor—one that runs functions on attribute accesses. \n",
    "* Coding differs too: a property is created with a built-in function, and a descriptor is coded with a class; as such, descriptors can leverage all the usual OOP features of classes, such as inheritance. \n",
    "* Moreover, in addition to the instance’s state information, descriptors have local state of their own, so they can avoid name collisions in the instance."

    "* Properties can be coded with decorator syntax. Because the property built-in accepts a single function argument, it can be used directly as a function decorator todefine a fetch access property. \n",
    "* Due to the name rebinding behavior of decorators,the name of the decorated function is assigned to a property whose get accessor is set to the original function decorated (name = property(name)). \n",
    "* Property setter and deleter attributes allow us to further add set and delete accessors with decoration syntax—they set the accessor to the decorated function and return the aug-\n",
