    "* Classes can support iteration by defining (or inheriting) __getitem__ or __iter__.\n",
    "* In all iteration contexts, Python tries to use __iter__ (which returns an object that supports the iteration protocol with a __next__ method) first: if no __iter__ is found by inheritance search, Python falls back on the __getitem__ indexing method (which is called repeatedly, with successively higher indexes)."

    "* The __str__ and __repr__ methods implement object print displays. \n",

    "* That is, __repr__ is used everywhere, except by print and str when a __str__ is defined. A __str__ is usually used for user-friendly displays;__repr__ gives extra details or the object’s as-code form."
